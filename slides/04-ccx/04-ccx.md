# CCX
### Custom Courses on edX

* in production now on edge.edx.org and edx.org
* still waiting for analytics
* working on gradebook improvements
* scheduling fixes
* better visibility for instructors

Note: CCX is a stealth feature now, but it's available on edge.edx.org and 
edx.org. So if someone wants to re-use one of your MOOCs now, you don't need to
copy it, you don't need to re-run. You just need to turn on the CCX flag and
then add them as a coach. We do have plans to monetize this, so it's worth 
talking to Lisa Schwallie about it first.
