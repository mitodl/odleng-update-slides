### Annotations

## Prior art in edX

* [edX "Annotation Problem"](http://edx.readthedocs.org/projects/edx-partner-course-staff/en/latest/exercises_tools/annotation.html)
  * course author shares annotations with students
  * text only
* ["Harvard Annotations" on edX](http://annotation.chs.harvard.edu/)
  * students share with each other and instructor
  * allows annotations on text, image and video
  * Harvard moving away from this towards an LTI solution
* [edX Student Notes](http://edx.readthedocs.org/projects/open-edx-building-and-running-a-course/en/named-release-birch/exercises_tools/student_notes.html)
  * private student annotations
  * text only

Note: student notes tool is screenreader- and keyboard-accessible
